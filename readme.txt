Let people share content on Twitter (a Tweet) without having to leave your web page. This app displays a Tweet button at the bottom of your site.

== Description ==

Promote your Twitter account at the same time while driving traffic to your website. Customize the default Tweet, set what URL to share in the tweet and set the option to show or hide the tweet count next to the tweet button. By allowing your site visitors to tweet about your site on their twitter accounts, it will help get the word out about your site and drive targeted traffic from twitter users who see the tweets directly to your site.
